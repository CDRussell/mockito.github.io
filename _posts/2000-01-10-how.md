## How do I drink it?

Recommended way of getting Mockito is [declaring a dependency](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/DeclaringMockitoDependency)
on "mockito-core" library (not "mockito-all"!) using your favorite build system.
With [Gradle](http://gradle.org) one can do:

{% highlight Groovy %}
repositories { jcenter() }
dependencies { testCompile "org.mockito:mockito-core:1.+" }
{% endhighlight %}

Maven users can declare a [dependency on mockito-core](link needed).
Mockito is automatically published to [Bintray's jcenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/org/mockito/mockito-core)
and synced to the Maven Central Repository.

Legacy builds with manual dependency management might use mockito-all package that can be downloaded from [Mockito's Bintray repository](https://bintray.com/szczepiq/maven/mockito/_latestVersion)
or [Bintray's jcenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/org/mockito/mockito-all).
The support for mockito-all will be removed in [Mockito 2.0](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/123)

## now you can verify interactions

{% highlight Java %}
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

// mock creation
List mockedList = mock(List.class);

// using mock object - it does not throw any "unexpected interaction" exception
mockedList.add("one");
mockedList.clear();

// selective, explicit, highly readable verification
verify(mockedList).add("one");
verify(mockedList).clear();
{% endhighlight %}

## and stub method calls

{% highlight Java %}
// you can mock concrete classes, not only interfaces
LinkedList mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class);

// stubbing appears before the actual execution
when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first");

// the following prints "first"
System.out.println(mockedList.get(0));

// the following prints "null" because get(999) was not subbed
System.out.println(mockedList.get(999));
{% endhighlight %}

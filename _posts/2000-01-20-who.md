Mockito is served to you by **[Szczepan Faber](https://github.com/szczepiq) and friends**. First people who tried Mockito were developers of the [Guardian](http://guardian.co.uk/) project in London in early 2008. Here is how Szczepan explained [why we need another mocking framework](http://monkeyisland.pl/2008/01/14/mockito)?

Firstly, hats down before **[EasyMock](http://easymock.org/) folks** for their ideas on beautiful and refactorable mocking syntax. First hacks on Mockito were done on top of the EasyMock code.

Here are just some of my friends who contributed ideas to Mockito (apologize if I missed somebody): **Igor Czechowski**, **Patric Fornasier**, **Jim Barritt**, **Felix Leipold**, **Liz Keogh**, **Bartosz Bańkowski**.

Now some other people joined the gang : **Brice Dutheil** then **David Wallace**.

Special thanks to **Erik Ramfelt**, and **Steve Christou** for putting Mockito on there Jenkins server (continuous integration) for a few years. Now Travis and Coveralls took over.

Thanks to **Karol Poźniak** for the original colorful logo and **Darek Chrzan** for the new one :)

Finally, thanks to **Erik Brakkee** who helps us getting jars to maven central

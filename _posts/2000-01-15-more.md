## More info

[Main reference documentation](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html) features:

* [`mock()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#mock(java.lang.Class))/[`@Mock`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mock.html): Create a mock (specify how it should behave via [`Answer`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#field_summary)/[`ReturnValue`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/ReturnValues.html)/[`MockSettings`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/MockSettings.html))
     * [`when()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#when(T))/[`given()`](https://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/BDDMockito.html#given(T)) to specify how a mock should behave.
     * If the provided answers doesn't fit your needs, write one yourself extending the [`Answer`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/stubbing/Answer.html) interface
* [`spy()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#spy(T))/[`@Spy`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Spy.html): Calls a real object but records what has been called,
* [`@InjectMocks`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/InjectMocks.html): Used as a kind of simple automatic dependency injection of fields created using the `@Spy` or `@Mock` annotation.
* [`verify()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#verify(T)) to check methods were called with given arguments; can match any expression via the [`any()`](https://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Matchers.html#any()), or capture what arguments where called using [`@Captor`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Captor.html) instead.
* Try BDD syntax with [BDDMockito](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/BDDMockito.html)
* Try the Mockito on Android, thanks to the Google guys working on dexmaker (more on that later)

## Remember

* Do not mock types you don't own
* Don't mock value objects
* Don't mock everything
* Show some love with your tests
